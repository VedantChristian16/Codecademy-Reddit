# Reddit Client - Vedant Christian

This project, developed as part of Codecademy, aims to create a minimalist Reddit experience. No account is needed, and all posts are sourced from the "/hot" section. Users can search for any subreddit without any history being logged or stored.  
**Mobile-friendly design included!**

## Wireframes

The project was carefully planned with wireframes to guide its development. View the wireframe of the website below:

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS (including react-icons, react-markdown, and react-loading-skeleton)
- Redux

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page will automatically reload upon edits, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm run build`

Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder.  
This command optimizes the React build for the best performance.

The build will be minified, and the filenames will include hashes. Your app is ready for deployment!

For more details on deployment, see the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Handling Build Errors

If you encounter issues with `npm run build` failing to minify, please refer to this section: [Build Troubleshooting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify).
